The  resulting  Treaty  of  Versailles  punished  \n\nGermany  in  a  number  of  ways,  including  making  Germany  pay  reparations  to  the  Allies.  Although  \n\na  German  delegation  was  present  at  Paris,  it  was  not  allowed  to  take  part  in  the  negotiations.  The  \n\nterms of the Treaty were really decided by Britain, France and the USA, and Germany was forced to \n\naccept them. There were claims at the time that the Treaty was far too harsh on Germany and would \n\ncause problems in the future. However, others have argued that Germany should have been punished \n\nmore harshly, and that the effects on Germany have been exaggerated. Was Germany punished too \n\nharshly? \n\nSOURCE A\n\nThe  United  States  expected  the  Europeans  to  pay  back  the  money  they  had  borrowed  during  the  \n\nwar.  For  the  Europeans,  reparations  promised  a  way  to  pay  off  their  debts.  France  had  suffered  the  \n\nmost direct damage, but Britain had spent the most. There were intense debates over the question of \n\nhow much Germany could pay. If the figure were set too high, the German economy might collapse, \n\nwhich would not help British exporters. If too low, Germany would be getting away lightly. Because the \n\npeacemakers  could  not  agree  on  a  final  figure,  a  special  commission  would  be  set  up  to  determine  \n\nwhat  Germany  should  pay.  This  understandably  brought  charges  from  the  Germans  that  they  were  \n\nbeing asked to sign a blank cheque.\n\nAlthough historians are increasingly coming to the conclusion that the burden was never as great as \n\nGermany  claimed,  reparations  remain  the  main  symbol  of  the  peace.  The  standard  view  is  that  the  \n\nreparations stand as evidence of a vindictive, short-sighted and poisonous document. Responsibility for \n\nthe disastrous consequences, so the argument goes, starts with the peacemakers of 1919. However, \n\nHitler  did  not  wage  war  because  of  the  Treaty  of  Versailles.  Even  if  Germany  had  been  left  with  its  \n\nold borders, and its military forces, he still would have wanted more. When war came in 1939, it was \n\na result of twenty years of decisions taken or not taken, not of the arrangements made in 1919. The \n\npeacemakers tried to build a better world but they struggled with huge and difficult questions.\n\nFrom a history book published in 2001.",

The Treaty of Versailles, which dealt with\n\nGermany, was signed on 28 June 1919. The Allies were divided over what to do about Germany and\n\ntheir discussions contained much arguing. Was the treaty that resulted from these discussions fair and\n\njust?\n\nSOURCE A\n\nAn  American  representative  at  Versailles  wrote  in  his  diary  ‘What  a  dreadful  mess  it  is.’  Georges\n\nClemenceau was under attack in France for being outwitted by the English. Lloyd George knew that he\n\nwas  heading  for  a  storm  of  criticism  for  his  failure  to  obtain  the  huge  reparation  payments  from  the\n\nGermans which he had promised the British public. But Lloyd George had deeper concerns. He had\n\ncome to fear that the treaty was too harsh, that perhaps it condemned Europe to another gigantic war.\n\nWoodrow Wilson had first come to Paris with great hopes – the conference represented the opportunity\n\nhe had always dreamed of – to completely remake the world according to the liberal and democratic\n\nideas  to  which  he  had  dedicated  his  life.  But  he  had  found  the  task  so  dominated  with  conflicting\n\nclaims, hatreds, fears and greeds, that he was forced to settle for a compromise that satisfied no one.\n\nA recent historian’s description of the Big Three on the day after the Treaty of Versailles was signed.\n\nSOURCE B\n\nNone of the Big Three lasted long after the Peace Conference. French voters thought that Clemenceau\n\nhad not done enough and that Germany had been left alarmingly strong. Lloyd George lost the support\n\nof voters and never held office after 1922. Wilson returned to the USA to campaign for active American\n\ninvolvement in world affairs but America rejected the League of Nations.\n\nHowever, the peace settlement addressed most problems. If organisations like the League of Nations\n\ndid not work as successfully as the peacemakers hoped, the fault lay less with them than with the next\n\ngeneration of politicians.\n\nA recent judgement about the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nSOURCE C\n\nWhat is difficult is to draw up a peace that will not provoke a struggle when those who took part in the\n\nwar have passed away. If Germany feels unjustly treated, she will find ways of getting revenge. Injustice\n\nor  arrogance  in  the  hour  of  triumph  will  never  be  forgiven  or  forgotten.  I  am  strongly  opposed  to\n\ntransferring more Germans to the rule of some other nation than can possibly be helped.\n\nFrom some private notes written by Lloyd George during the peace negotiations, March 1919.",
